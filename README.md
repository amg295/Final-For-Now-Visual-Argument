# Final For Now Visual Argument
 Introduction: 
   This visual argument is designed to portray the dangers of social media and how it is inescapable. Each of the four quadrants portray different aspects and areas of life where different apps are prevalent. These days, there is an app or program for everything. Social media has become an addiction that affects society and personal lives whether it is realized or not. This is meant to appeal to a large audience from young women, children, and adults to show that it is a universal problem. By looking at the image, the viewer should be able to relate in some way. It is as if technology is infiltrating our daily lives and has become a key component to maintaining social and professional ties. My aim was to inlcude balance and design elements that are pleasing to the viewer without being too congested or confusing.
